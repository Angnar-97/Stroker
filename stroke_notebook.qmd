# About Data Analysis Report

This RMarkdown file contains the report of the data analysis done for the project on building and deploying a stroke prediction model in R. It contains analysis such as data exploration, summary statistics and building the prediction models. The final report was completed on `r date()`. 

**Data Description:**

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.

This data set is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient.
